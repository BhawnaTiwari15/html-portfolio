<h1>The Best Movies According To Bhawna</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>Parasite begins a comedy but will turn into dark comedy/ thriller before you will realize. I was completely awe-struck after watching the movie and my appreciation for the movie has breached every boundary. Parasite is an absolute masterpiece and I would recommend it very strongly.</p>
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>Masterpiece. A Masterpiece.<br/>
    It was a visual treat for a cinema lover like me whoâ€™s a big fan of cult classics like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.</p>
<h3>3Idiots</h3>
<p>
ALL IS WELL!!<br/>    This film has 2 sides , the one which amazes you and makes you laugh while the other which makes you realize the reality of engineering colleges. I have a soft corner for this film and watched may times.</p>
